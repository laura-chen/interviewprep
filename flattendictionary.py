# Flatten a Dictionary
#
# A dictionary is a type of data structure that is supported natively in all
# major interpreted languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP, where
# itâ€™s known as an Object, Dictionary, Hash and Array, respectively. In simple
# terms, a dictionary is a collection of unique keys and their values. The values
# can typically be of any primitive type (i.e an integer, boolean, double,
# string etc) or other dictionaries (dictionaries can be nested). However, for
# this exercise assume that values are either an integer, a string or another
# dictionary.
#
# Given a dictionary dict, write a function flattenDictionary that returns a
# flattened version of it .

# Example:
# input:  dict = {
#             "Key1" : "1",
#             "Key2" : {
#                 "a" : "2",
#                 "b" : "3",
#                 "c" : {
#                     "d" : "3",
#                     "e" : "1"
#                 }
#             }
#         }
#
# output: {
#             "Key1" : "1",
#             "Key2.a" : "2",
#             "Key2.b" : "3",
#             "Key2.c.d" : "3",
#             "Key2.c.e" : "1"
#         }

# Important: when you concatenate keys, make sure to add the dot character
# between them. For instance concatenating Key2, c and d the result key would
# be Key2.c.d.
